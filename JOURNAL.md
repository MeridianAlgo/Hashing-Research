## 10/21/2025 - Bitaxe Startup  

# üöÄ Project Kickoff

## Date: October 21, 2025

### üí° Project Overview
We launched our crypto hashing optimization project using **Bitaxes' open-source software**. Goal: Reduce energy costs to achieve profitability in nightly runs.

### üîç Sourcing Materials
- **Software**: Downloaded Bitaxes hashing tool from official GitHub repo ([[github.com/bitaxes/crypto-hash](https://github.com/bitaxes/crypto-hash)](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/bitaxeGamma)). Free, commercially licensed under MIT‚Äîanyone can use/modify.
- **Hardware**: Standard desktop PC (Intel i7, 16GB RAM) with integrated GPU. No extras needed; software runs on CPU/GPU.
- **Data Sources**: Power metrics from software logs; electricity rates from local utility site (e.g., $0.15/kWh avg. US rate).

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Process
1. **Install**: Cloned repo via `git clone https://github.com/bitaxeorg/bitaxeGamma.git` in terminal.
2. **Configure**: Ran `npm install` (Node.js env); set params for 30-min hashing cycles targeting BTC-like algo.
3. **Test Run**: Executed `./hash-run.sh` in command line. Monitored via `htop` for CPU/GPU usage.
4. **Measure Power**: Used Kill-A-Watt meter plugged into PC‚Äîpeaked at 50W during hash bursts. Ran overnight sim: ~4kWh/night.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Challenge
Current design guzzles **50W every 30 mins**! Nightly ops (8hrs) = ~800Wh/day. At $0.15/kWh, that's **$0.12/day**‚Äîbut scaled to full mining rig? Drains bank via bills, no break-even on crypto rewards (est. $0.05-0.10/night at current BTC hash rates).

### üìä Energy Consumption Chart
Visualizing power draw over 30-min cycle (simulated data from test run).

### üí∞ Cost Projection Chart
Monthly energy cost if run nightly (30 days, 8hrs/night) vs. break-even threshold.

### üéØ Next Steps
Optimize for <20W. Test tweaks by next week. Energy savings = profit gains! 


*We wanted to clarify WE DO COLLECT PROFITS FROM THIS PROJECT FOR OUR OWN GAIN because we used the consumption TEST MODE only, so the miner never mined actual tokens*
