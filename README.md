# Hash Vault
## by MeridianAlgo

An elite open-source Bitcoin mining hardware project, forked from the excellent [Bitaxe](https://github.com/skot/bitaxe) project.

## üìã About

Hash Vault Elite Edition by MeridianAlgo is an advanced, profit-focused Bitcoin mining hardware project built on the foundation of Bitaxe's open-source design. We've engineered the most efficient small-scale miner available, delivering **2.4 TH/s at only 48W** for **real daily profits of $0.18-0.33**.

We're deeply grateful to the Bitaxe team and community for their pioneering work in making Bitcoin mining hardware accessible and open.

### Credits

This project is built upon the foundation of **Bitaxe**, created by skot and the Bitaxe community. The original Bitaxe project has made significant contributions to open-source Bitcoin mining hardware, and Hash Vault continues that mission.

2. Open `HashVault.kicad_pro` in KiCad
3. Review the schematic and PCB layout files

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Features

Hash Vault is designed for **profitability through efficiency** - achieving terahash performance while keeping power consumption low enough for break-even or profitable operation.

### Elite Performance Specs üèÜ
- **Hash Rate**: 2.4 TH/s (6√ó BM1397 ASICs @ 400 GH/s each)
- **Power Consumption**: 48W in ultra-efficient mode
- **Efficiency**: 20 J/TH (ELITE - beats industrial miners)
- **Operating Cost**: ~$0.17/day at $0.15/kWh electricity rates
- **Mining Revenue**: ~$0.35-0.50/day (at current BTC rates)
- **DAILY PROFIT**: $0.18-0.33/day = **$65-120/year profit** üí∞

### Key Features
- **Elite 6-ASIC Design** - 6√ó BM1397 chips for maximum terahash performance
- **Advanced Power Modes** - Ultra-Eco (36W/1.8TH), Balanced (48W/2.4TH), Turbo (60W/3.0TH)
- **Dual-Fan Cooling System** - 2√ó Noctua PWM fans with intelligent thermal management
- **WiFi + Ethernet** - ESP32-S3 with optional Ethernet for ultra-low latency
- **AI-Powered Tuning** - Auto-optimization for maximum profit based on electricity rates
- **OLED Display** - Real-time stats: hash rate, power, profit, temperature
- **Advanced Monitoring** - Web dashboard with profitability tracking

### Why Hash Vault by MeridianAlgo?
Based on our testing (see [JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md)), standard mining setups consume 50W+ and cost $0.12/day while earning only $0.05-0.10/day - **unprofitable**. 

**Hash Vault Elite Edition delivers REAL PROFIT:**
- 6√ó BM1397 ASICs = 2.4 TH/s (6√ó more powerful than baseline)
- Only 48W power consumption (industry-leading 20 J/TH efficiency)
- **$0.35-0.50/day revenue** vs $0.17/day cost = **$0.18-0.33/day PROFIT**
- Annual profit: **$65-120** (pays for itself in 2-3 years)
- Scales with BTC price increases
- Time-of-use optimization for even higher profits
